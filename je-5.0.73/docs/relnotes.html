<h2><a name="overview">Overview</a></h2>
<p>
Berkeley DB Java Edition (JE) is a 100% pure Java embedded,
transactional data store. It supplies a key/object data model with
indexing, full transactional ACID support, POJO APIs and High Availability/Replication.
</p>
<p>
This is release 5.0.73 of Berkeley DB Java Edition.  This release
includes a file format change, and there are two important notes to be aware
of.
<ol>
    <li>
    The file format change enabled significant improvements in operation
    performance, memory and disk footprint, and concurrency of databases with
    duplicate keys. Due to these changes, an upgrade utility must be run before
    opening an environment with this release, if the environment was created
    using JE 4.1 or earlier. See the Upgrade Procedure of the change log for
    more information.
    </li>
    <li>
    An application which uses JE replication may not upgrade directly from JE
    4.0 to JE 5.0. Instead, the upgrade must be done from JE 4.0 to JE 4.1 and
    then to JE 5.0. Applications already at JE 4.1 are not affected. Upgrade
    guidance can be found in the new chapter, "Upgrading a JE Replication
    Group", in the "Getting Started with BDB JE High Availability" guide.
    </li>
</ol>
<p>
A number of enhancements have been added since version JE 4.1, including:
<ul>
    <li>
    The new <code>DiskOrderedCursor</code> class can be used to iterate over
    all records in a database, for increased performance when transactional
    guarantees are not required.  [#15260]
    </li>
    <li>
    A new <code>Environment.preload</code> method can be used to preload
    multiple databases at a time, for increased performance compared to
    preloading each database individually. [#18153]
    </li>
    <li>
    The JE environment can now be spread across multiple subdirectories to take
    advantage of multiple disks or file systems. [#19125]
    </li>
    <li>
    The new <code>AppStateMonitor</code> class lets the HA application add more
    application specific information to the notion of node state in a
    replication group.  [#18046]
    </li>
    <li>
    New options have been added for changing the host of a JE replication node,
    and for moving a JE replication group. See the Utilities section of the
    change log.
    </li>
    <li>
    Replicated nodes can now be opened in UNKNOWN state, to support read only
    operations in a replicated system when a master is not available.  [#19338]
    </li>
    <li>
    New <code>Cursor</code> methods were added to allow quickly skipping over a
    specified number of key/value pairs.  [#19165]
    </li>
    <li>
    A per-Environment <code>ClassLoader</code> may now be configured and will
    be used by JE for loading all user-supplied classes. [#18368]
    </li>
    <li>
    The <code>java.io.Closeable</code> interface is now implemented by all JE
    classes and interfaces with a <code>public void close()</code> method.
    This allows using these objects with the Java 1.7 try-with-resources
    statement. [#20559]
    </li>
    <li>
    The <code>Environment.flushLog</code> method has been added. It can be used
    to make durable, by writing to the log, all preceding non-transactional
    write operations, without performing a checkpoint. [#19111]
    </li>
    <li>
    Performance of record update and deletion operations has been significantly
    improved when the record is not in the JE cache and the application does
    not need to read the record prior to performing the update or deletion.
    [#18633]
    </li>
    <li>
    An internal format change was made for databases with duplicate keys that
    improves operation performance, reduces memory and disk overhead, and
    increases concurrency.  [#19165]
    </li>
    <li>
    An improvement has been made that requires significantly less writing per
    checkpoint, less writing during eviction, and less metadata overhead in the
    JE on-disk log files.  [#19671]
    </li>
    <li>
    Improved <code>DbCacheSize</code> utility to take into account memory
    management enhancements and improve accuracy. Added support for key
    prefixing, databases configured for sorted duplicates, and replicated
    environments.  [#20145]
    </li>
    <li>
    <code>EnvironmentConfig.TREE_COMPACT_MAX_KEY_LENGTH</code> was added for
    user configuration of the in-memory compaction of keys in the Btree.
    [#20120]
    </li>
</ul>
